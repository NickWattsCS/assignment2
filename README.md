NOTE: This was technically submitted late, but at 12:01. Part of the reason it took so long was 
because I forgot to include Monorail.cpp in the g++ statement while trying to test the module in 
linprog. This caused the Monorail constructor to not be recognized, as shown in the commits for 
my repository, which caused me to lose time. Were it not for this oversight in an admittedly long 
command line argument for g++, the assignment would have been submitted before midnight.
